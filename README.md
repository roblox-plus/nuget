# Roblox+ NuGet

This repository hosts the (unofficial) [Roblox](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Roblox) NuGet package.

This package is not published by Roblox, and I am willing to hand it over to Roblox if asked, and if it will be put to official use.

In the meantime, I'm publishing a NuGet package to be consumed by the community, for .NET development against Roblox.
